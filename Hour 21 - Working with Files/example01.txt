e-Traction
Sustainable mobility

Today we are lucky to be more mobile than ever before. But we also need to face the downside of our mobility. 
Air pollution from vehicles impairs the quality of urban life and peopleâ€™s health. 
Heavy use of fossil fuels depletes our natural resources. And emissions from conventional combustion engines contribute to climate change. As engineers, we are challenged and dedicated to find both environmentally and economically competitive alternatives. The future is now, as e-Traction has created superior, distinguished and patented powertrain technology for e-mobility. Our evolving technology enables manufacturers to produce extremely energy efficient vehicles with zero emissions, that offer reduced maintenance efforts to its owners and optimal total cost of ownership. The revolution in motion has begun!
